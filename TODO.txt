TODO List
    Symbol
        Add jackson deserialization

    SymbolFilter
        Create a filter method with a method signature of
            List<Symbol> filter(List<Symbol> symbols, Symbol filter)
            This will allow filtered lists to fed back into be filtered again

    SemanticsVisitor
        Fix overloaded methods not finding the correct Symbol
            This is happening because the SemanticsVisitor::visitMethodDeclaration 
            findSymbolId cannot find methods bases on the different parameters
        Fix template classes/methods on the second pass
        Have traceScopeToFindSymbolId method use the new filter method where
            a list of Symbols matching the supplied text is filtered on rather
            than filtering on the entire Symbol map each time

    CompilerTest
        Move the compile methods out of this class into their own TestingUtils class

    Add more unit tests for the following:
        SymbolTableVisitor
        SemanticsVisitor
        SymbolTableUtils
        SymbolFilter
        syntax
